- **Concentration Risk**: Heavy reliance on a few stocks (AAPL, NVDA) may lead to increased risk if these stocks underperform in the future.

## Actionable Suggestions
1. **Reassess MSFT Position**: Given its low forward return, consider reducing exposure to MSFT to free up capital for better-performing assets.
2. **Monitor NVDA**: Maintain a hold on NVDA while closely monitoring its performance, as it has shown strong returns but may be subject to market fluctuations.
3. **Increase Allocation to AAPL**: Given its strong forward return, consider increasing the allocation to AAPL to capitalize on its growth potential.
